\chapter{Introduction to Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning}

In this chapter, we introduce the basic concepts and ideas behind machine learning.
We will outline how machine learning related to traditional statistical approaches that you already might now (and as you will see, there is a lot of overlap), present different types of models, and discuss how to validate them.

In a later chapter [ADD REFERENCE TO TEXT ANALYSIS CHAPTER], we will then specifically apply the knoweldge you gained from this chapter to the analysis of textual data, arguably one of the most interesting tasks in the computational analysis of communication.
