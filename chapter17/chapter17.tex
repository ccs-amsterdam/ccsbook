\chapter{Scaling up and distributing}
\label{chap:scalingup}

\begin{abstract}
  Throughout this book, we were working with examples that consisted of
  code to conduct one specific analysis of data datasets of modest size.
  But at one point, you may want to scale up. You may want that others
  can apply your code to their data; and you may want to be able to also
  use your own analyses on larger and more complex datasets. Or you may
  need to run analyses that your own computer cannot deal with.
  This chapters deal with such  steps and point you to some techiques that become increasingly useful
  the larger your projects get.

\begin{objectives}
\item Be able to scale up your analyses
\item Know when to use databases
\item Know when to use cloud computing
\item Know about distributing source code and containers.
\end{objectives}

\begin{feature}
In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of techniques for scaling up computational analyses. In particular, we introduces SQL and noSQL databases, cloud computing platforms, version control systems, and Docker containers.
