\chapter{Text as Data}
\label{chap:dtm}

\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
  
This chapter shows you how to do `data wrangling' in R and Python.
Data wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into a shape that is suitable for analysis. The sections of this chapter first take you through the normal data wrangling pipeline of
filtering, changing, grouping, and joining data. Finally, the last section shows how you can
reshape data.

\keywords{Text as Data, Document-Term Matrix}

\begin{objectives}
\item Create a document-term matrix from text
\item Perform feature and document selection and weighting
\item Understand and use more advanced representations such as n-grams and embeddings
\end{objectives}

\begin{feature}
  This chapter shows how you can analyze texts that are stored as a data frame column or variable using functions from the package \pkg{quanteda} in R and the package \pkg{sklearn} in Python in Python and R.
  Please see \refsec{readtext} for more information on reading and cleaning text and see \refsec{installing} for information on installing these packages.
