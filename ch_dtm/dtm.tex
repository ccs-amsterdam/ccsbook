\section{The bag of words and term-document matrix}
\label{sec:dtm}

Before we can analyse text using the computer, the text must be represented in a way that is understandable for the computer.

The Document-term matrix (DTM, also called the term-document matrix or TDM) is a common numerical representation of text.
This represents a corpus as a matrix or table, where each row represents a document, each column represents a term (word),
and the numbers in each cell show how often that word occurs in that document.
