\section{Using existing libraries and APIs}
\label{sec:apivisions}

In this section we cover libraries for Optical character recognition and speech-to-text. Also How to convert scanned documents into text files for further analysis. In addition we mention commercial providers (e.g., Google Vision) that offer APIs that return tags for uploaded images, which makes image recognition available for everyone. We discuss how to use such services, their advantages and limitations.
