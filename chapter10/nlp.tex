\section{Basic natural language processing}
\label{sec:nlp}


This section outlines how to go a step further and use natural language processing (NLP) to, for instance, parsing sentences, stemming or lemmatization. Using such part-of-speech tagging (POS), we can for example only retain nouns and adjectives, or any other element of interest. Similarly, we can use named entity recognition (NER) to extract names of persons, organizations, or locations. We will use spacy (Python and R).
