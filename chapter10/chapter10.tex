\label{chap:protext}


\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
Many data sets that are relevant for social science consist of textual data, from political discussions and newspaper archives to open-ended survey questions and reviews. This chapter gives an introduction in dealing with textual data using base functions in Python and (mostly) the \pkg{stringr} package in R.

\begin{feature}
  \textbf{Packages used in this chapter}\\
  This chapter introduces the packages for handling textual data.
  For R, this is mainly the \pkg{stringr} package (included in \tidyverse).
  In Python, most functions are built-in, but will show how to use these functions in \pkg{pandas} and also introduce the \pkg{regex} alternative to built-in regular expressions.
You can install these packages with the code below if needed  (see \refsec{installing} for more details):

\doublecodex{chapter10/chapter10install}

\noindent After installing, you need to import (activate) the packages every session:

\doublecodex{chapter10/chapter10library}
