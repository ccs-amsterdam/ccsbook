\section{Social network analysis}
\label{sec:sna}

This section gives an overview of the existing measures to conduct social network analysis (SNA). Among other descriptors, we explain how to examine paths and reachability, centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector) to quantify the importance of a node in a graph, and clustering or community detection.

The first idea that comes into our minds when analysing a graph is to understand how their nodes are connected. When multiple edges create a network we can observe how the vertices constitute one or many paths that can be described. In this sense, a \texttt{sequence} between node \textit{x} and node \textit{y} is a path where each node is \texttt{adjacent} to the previous. In the imaginary social network of friendship of American politicians contained in the undirected graph \texttt{g1}, we can determine the sequences or simple paths between any pair of politicians. As shown in \refex{path} we can use the function \fn{all\_simple\_paths} contained in both \pkg{igraph} (R) and \pkg{networkx} (Python), to obtain the two possible sequences between Barack Obama and John McCain. The shortest path includes the nodes Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump; and the longer includes Bernie Sanders, Clinton and Trump.

One specific type of path is the one in which the initial node is the same than the final node. This closed path is called a \texttt{circuit}. To understand this concept let us recover the inducted subgraph of Democrat politicians \texttt{g3} in which we only have three nodes. If you plot this graph, as we do in \refex{circuit}, you can clearly visualize how a circuit works.

In SNA it is extremely important to be able to describe the possible paths since they help us to estimate the reachability of the vertices. For instance, if we go back to our original graph of American politicians in Facebook \texttt{g1} visualized in \refex{visgraph} we can see that Sanders is reachable from McCain because there is a path between the (McCain - Trump - Clinton - Sanders).  Moreover, we observe that this social network is fully \texttt{connected} because you can reach a given node from any other node in the graph. But it might not always be that way. Imagine that we remove the friendship of Clinton and Trump by deleting that specific edge that joins Republicans and Democrats. As you can observe in \refex{component}, when we create and visualize the graph \texttt{g6} without this edge we can see that the network is not longer fully connected and it has two \texttt{components}. Technically speaking, we would say for example that the subgraph of Republicans is a connected component of the network of American politicians, given that this connected subgraph is part of the bigger graph while not connected to it.

When analysing paths and reachability you may be interested in knowing the distances in your graph. One common question is what is the average path length of a social network, or in other words, what is the average of the shortest distance between each pair of vertices in the graph. This \texttt{mean distance} can tell you a lot about how close are the nodes in the network: the shorter the distance the closer the nodes are. Moreover, you can estimate the specific distance (shortest path) between two specific nodes.  As shown in \refex{distance} we can estimate the average path length (1.7) in our imaginary Facebook network of American politicians using the functions \fn{mean\_distance} in \pkg{igraph} and \fn{average\_shortest\_path\_length} in \pkg{networkx}. In this example we also estimate the specific distance in the network between Obama and McCain (3) using the function \fn{distances} in \pkg{igraph} and estimating the length (\fn{len}) of the shortest path (first result of \fn{shortest\_simple\_paths} minus 1) in \pkg{networkx}.

\pyrex[output=both,caption=Estimating distances in the network]{chapter14/distance}

In terms of distance, we can also wonder what are the edges or nodes that share a border with any given vertex. In the first case, we can identify the \texttt{incident edges} that go out or into one vertex. As shown in \refex{incident}, by using the the functions \fn{incident} in \pkg{igraph} and \fn{edges} in \pkg{networkx} we can easily get incident edges of John McCain in Facebook Network \texttt{g1}, which is just one single edge that joins Trump with McCain. In the second case, we can also identify its adjacent nodes, or in other words its \texttt{neighbours}. In very same example, we use \fn{neighbors} (same function in \pkg{igraph} and \pkg{networkx}) to obtain the all nodes one step away from McCain (in this case only Trump).

There are some other interesting descriptors of social networks. One of the most common measures is the \texttt{density} of the graph, which accounts for the proportion of edges relative to all possible ties in the network. In simpler words, the density tells us from 0 to 1 how much connected are the nodes of a graph and it can be estimated for both, undirected and directed graphs. Using the functions \fn{edge\_density} in \pkg{igraph} and \fn{density} in \pkg{networkx} we obtain a density of 0.5 (middle level) in the imaginary Facebook network of American politicians (undirected graph) and 0.35 in the Twitter network (directed graph). 

In undirected graphs we can also measure \texttt{transitivity} and \texttt{diameter}. The first is a key property of social networks that refers to the ratio of triangles over the total amount of connected triples. It is to say that we wonder how likely is that two nodes are connected if they share a mutual neighbour. Applying the function \fn{transitivity} (included in \pkg{igraph} and \pkg{networkx}) to \texttt{g1} we can see that this tendency is of 0.5 in the Facebook network. The second descriptor, the diameter, depicts the length of the network in terms of the longest geodesic distance. We use the function \fn{diameter} (included in \pkg{igraph} and \pkg{networkx}) in the Facebook network and get a diameter of 3, which you can also check if you go back to the visualization of \texttt{g1} in \refex{visgraph}. 

Additionally, in directed graphs we can calculate the \texttt{reciprocity}, which is just the proportion of reciprocal ties in a social network and can be computed with the function \fn{diameter} (included in \pkg{igraph} and \pkg{networkx}). For the imaginary Twitter network (directed graph) we get a reciprocity of 0.57 (which is not bad for a Twitter graph where important people usually have much more followers than follows!).

In \refex{density} we show hot to estimate these four measures in R and Python. Notice that in some of the network descriptors you have to decide whether to include or not the edges weights for computation (in the provided examples we did not take these weights into account).

\pyrex[output=both,caption={Estimations of density, transitivity, diameter and reciprocity}]{chapter14/density}

Now let us move to \texttt{centrality measures}. Centrality is probably the most common dimension in the analysis of social networks because it gives you a clear idea of the importance of any of the nodes within a graph. Using its measures you can pose many questions such as which is the most central person in a network of friends in Facebook, who can be considerer an opinion leader in Twitter or who is an influencer in Instagram. Moreover, knowing the specific importance of every node of the network can help us to visualize or label only certain vertices that overpass a determine threshold, or to use a color scale to distinguish the most central nodes from the others. There are four typical centrality measures: \texttt{degree}, \texttt{closeness}, \texttt{eigenvector} and \texttt{betweenness}.

The \texttt{degree} of a node refers to the number of ties of that vertex, or in other words, to the number of edges that are incident to that node. This definition is constant for undirected graphs in which the directions of the links are not declared. In the case of directed graphs, you will have three options to measure the degree. First, you can think of the amount of edges pointing \texttt{in} any node, which we call \texttt{in degree}; second, we have the number of edges pointing \texttt{out} any node, or \texttt{out degree}. In addition, we could also have the total number of edges pointing (in and out) any node. \texttt{Degree}, as well of other measures of centrality mentioned below, can be expressed in absolute numbers, but also we can \texttt{normalize} these measure for better interpretation and and comparison. We will prefer this last approach in our examples, which is also the default option in many SNA packages.

We can then estimate the degree of two of our example networks. In \refex{centrality1} we first estimated the degree of each of the five American politicians in the imaginary Facebook network, which is a undirected graph; and the the total degree in the Twitter network, which is a directed graph. For both cases, we use the functions \fn{degree} in \pkg{igraph} (R) and \fn{degree\_centrality} in \pkg{networkx} (Python). We later computed the \texttt{in} and \texttt{out} degree for the Twitter network. In \pkg{igraph} we used again the function \fn{degree} but adjusting the parameter \texttt{mode} to "in" or "our", respectively; and in \pkg{networkx} we employed the functions \fn{in\_degree\_centrality} and \fn{out\_degree\_centrality}.

\pyrex[output=both,caption={Computing degree centralities in undirected and directed graphs}]{chapter14/centrality1}

There are three other types of centrality measures. \texttt{Closeness} centrality refers to the geodesic distance of a node to the rest of nodes in the graph. Specifically, it indicates how close a node is from the others by taking the length of the shortest paths between the vertices. \texttt{Eigenvector} centrality takes into account the importance of the surrounding nodes and computes the centrality of a vertex based on the centrality of its neighbours. In technical words, the measure is proportional to the sum of connection centralities. Finally, \texttt{betweenness} centrality indicates to which extent the node is in the paths that connect many other nodes. Mathematically it is computed as the sum of the fraction of every pair of (shortest) paths that go through the analysed node. 

As shown in \refex{centrality2}, we can obtain these three measures from undirected graphs using the functions \fn{closeness}, \fn{eigen\_centrality} and \fn{betweenness} in \pkg{igraph}, and \fn{closeness\_centrality}, \fn{eigenvector\_centrality} and \fn{betweenness\_centrality} in \pkg{networkx}. If we take a look to the centrality measures foe every politician of the imaginary Facebook network we see that Clinton seems to be a very important and central node of the graph, just coinciding with with the above-mentioned findings based on the degree. It is not a rule that we obtain the very same trend in each of the centrality measures but it is likely that they have similar results since they are looking for different dimensions of the same construct.

\pyrex[output=both,caption={Estimations of density, transitivity, diameter and reciprocity}]{chapter14/centrality2}

We can use these centrality measures in many ways. For example, you can take the degree centrality as a parameter of the node size and labelling when plotting the network. This may be of great utility since the reader can visually identify the most important nodes of the network while minimizing the visual impact of those that are less central. In \refex{plotsize} we decided to specify the size of the nodes (parameters \verb|vertex.size| in \pkg{igraph} and \verb|node_size| in \pkg{networkx}) with the degree centrality of each of the American politicians in the Twitter network (directed graph) contained in \texttt{g2}. We also used the degree centrality to filter the labels in the graph, and then included only those that overpassed a threshold of 0.5 (parameters \verb|vertex.label| in \pkg{igraph} and \verb|labels| in \pkg{networkx}). These two simple parameters of the plot gives you a fair image of the potentiality of the centrality measures to describe and understand your social network.
