\section{Social network analysis}
\label{sec:sna}

Measures and descriptors to analyze social networks. Paths and reachability (sequences, circuits, subgraphs and connected components). Centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector) and their role in quantifying the importance of a node in a graph.  Clustering or community detection.
