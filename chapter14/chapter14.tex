\chapter{Introduction to Network Data}
\label{chap:network}

\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
  
Especially social media data, but also other types of data can often be represented as networks. This chapter introduces \pkg{igraph} (R+Python) and \pkg{networkx} (Python) to showcase how to deal with such data, perform Social Network Analysis (SNA) and represent it visually.

\begin{objectives}
\item Understand how can networks be represented and visualized
\item Conduct basic description of networks
\item Perform Social Network Analysis
\end{objectives}

\begin{feature}
This chapter uses functions from the package \pkg{igraph} in R and the package \pkg{networks} in Python. You will create graphs and social networks by yourself, and then will be able to perform different types of analysis, from description to clustering.
\end{feature}
