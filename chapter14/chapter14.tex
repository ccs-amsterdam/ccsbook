\chapter{Network Data}
\label{chap:network}

\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
  
Especially social media data, but also other types of data can often be represented as networks. This chapter introduces \pkg{igraph} (R+Python) and \pkg{networkx} (Python) to showcase how to deal with such data, perform Social Network Analysis (SNA) and represent it visually.

\item Understand how can networks be represented and visualized
\item Conduct basic description of networks
\item Perform Social Network Analysis
\end{objectives}

\begin{feature}
  \textbf{Packages used in this chapter}\\
  This chapter uses functions from the package \pkg{igraph} in R and the package \pkg{networkx} in Python.
  In Python we will also use the \pkg{python-louvain} packages which introduces the Louvain clustering functions in \pkg{community}.
  %You will create graphs and social networks by yourself, and then will be able to perform different types of analysis, from description to clustering.
  You can install these packages with the code below if needed  (see \refsec{installing} for more details):

\noindent After installing, you need to import (activate) the packages every session:
