\chapter{Programming concepts for data analysis}
\label{chap:programmingconcepts}

\begin{abstract}This chapter introduces readers to the basics of programming
  in Python and R. It
explains how to deal with objects, statements, expressions, variables
and different types of data, and shows how to create and understand
simple control structures such as loops and conditions.

\begin{objectives}
\item Understand objects and data types
\item Write control strucutures
\item Use functions and methods
\end{objectives}

\begin{feature}
In this chapter, you will learn the
basics of programming that are needed for computational analysis of
communications: datatypes such as strings and integers, lists and
dictionaries, vectors and factors; control structures such as for
loops and if statements; functions and methods that you can apply to
your data.

So far you have taken your first steps as a programmer, but there many
more advanced things to learn that are out of the scope of this
book. You can find a lot of literature, online documentation and even
wonderful Youtube tutorials to keep learning. We can recommend the
books by \cite{crawley2012r} and \cite{vanderplas2016python} to have
more insights of R and Python, respectively. In the next chapter, we
will get deeper into the world of code in order to learn how and why
to re-use existing code, what to do if you are stock during your
programming journey and what are the best practices when coding.
