\chapter{Programming concepts for data analysis}
\label{chap:programmingconcepts}

\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
  This chapter introduces readers to the basics of programming
  in Python and R. It
explains how to deal with objects, statements, expressions, variables
and different types of data, and shows how to create and understand
simple control structures such as loops and conditions.

  \textbf{Packages used in this chapter}\\
  This chapter focuses on the built-in capabilities of Python and R,
  so does not rely on many packages.
  For R, only \pkg{glue} is used (which allows nice text formatting).
  For Python, we only use the packages \pkg{numpy} and \pkg{pandas}
  for data frame support.
  If needed, you can install these packages with the code below
  (see \refsec{installing} for more details):
  \doublecodex{chapter03/chapter03install}
  \noindent After installing, you need to import (activate) the packages every session:
  \doublecodex{chapter03/chapter03libraries}

So far you have taken your first steps as a programmer, but there many
more advanced things to learn that are out of the scope of this
book. You can find a lot of literature, online documentation and even
wonderful Youtube tutorials to keep learning. We can recommend the
books by \cite{crawley2012r} and \cite{vanderplas2016python} to have
more insights of R and Python, respectively. In the next chapter, we
will get deeper into the world of code in order to learn how and why
to re-use existing code, what to do if you are stock during your
programming journey and what are the best practices when coding.
