So far you have taken your first steps as a programmer, but there many more advanced things to learn that are out of the scope of this book. You can find a lot of literature, online documentation and even wonderful Youtube tutorials to keep learning. We can recommend the works by M. Crawley\cite{crawley2012r}  and J. VanderPlas\cite{vanderplas2016python}  to have more insights of R and Python, respectively. In the next chapter, we will get deeper into the world of code in order to learn how and why to re-use existing code, what to do if you are stock during your programming journey and what are the best practices when coding.
