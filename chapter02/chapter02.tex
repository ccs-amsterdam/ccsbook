\chapter{Getting started: Fun with Data and Visualizations}
\label{chap:fundata}

\begin{abstract}
  This chapter gives a lightning tour of some of the cool (and informative) things you can do with R and Python.
  Starting from a dataset of tweets about COVID-19, we show how you can analyse this data using
  text analysis, network analysis, and using geographic information.
  The goal of this chapter is not to teach you all these techniques in detail.
  Rather, each of the examples showcases a possibility and guides you to the chapter where it will be explained in more detail.
  So don't worry too much about understanding every line of code, but relax and enjoy the ride!

  \textbf{Packages used in this chapter}\\
  Since this chapter showcases a wide variety of possibilities,
  it relies on quite a number of third party packages.
  If needed, you can install these packages with the code below
  (see \refsec{installing} for more details):
  \doublecodex{chapter02/chapter02install}
  \noindent After installing, you need to import (activate) the packages every session:
  \doublecodex{chapter02/chapter02library}
\end{feature}
