\chapter{Scraping online data}
\label{chap:scraping}

\begin{abstract}
In this chapter, you learn how to retrieve your data from online sources. We first discuss the use of application programming interfaces, so-called APIs, which allow you to retrieve data from social media platforms, but also government data or other forms of open data, in a machine-readable format. We then discuss how to do web scraping in a narrower sense to retrieve data from websites that do not offer an API. We also discuss how to deal with authentication mechanisms, cookies, and the like, as well as ethical, legal, and practical considerations.
