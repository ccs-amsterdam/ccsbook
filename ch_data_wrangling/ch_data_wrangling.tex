\chapter{Data Wrangling}

This chapter shows you have you can do `data wrangling' in R and Python.
Data wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into a shape that is suitable for analysis.
This often involves steps like filtering, adjusting, aggregating, joining, or reshaping the data.


\note{This chapter uses function from the tidyverse (R) and pandas (Python) packages. See \refsec{installing} for information on installing these packages, and \refsec{loading} for an explanation of reading in data from various sources. In this chapter we read the data directly from the Internet page of this book, but instead of a URL you can also use a local file name.}
