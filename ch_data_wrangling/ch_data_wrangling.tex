\chapter{Data Wrangling}
\label{chap:datawrangling}

\begin{abstract}{Abstract}
This chapter shows you how to do `data wrangling' in R and Python.
Data wrangling is the process of transforming raw data into a shape that is suitable for analysis. The sections of this chapter first take you through the normal data wrangling pipeline of
filtering, changing, grouping, and joining data. Finally, the last section shows how you can
reshape data.

  \textbf{Packages used in this chapter}\\
  This chapter uses the \pkg{readxl} package for reading excel files and various parts of the \pkg{tidyverse} including \pkg{ggplot2}, \pkg{dplyr}, and \pkg{tidyr} (which are installed automatically when you install tidyverse). In Python we rely mostly on the \pkg{pandas} package, but we also use \pkg{scipy} package for statistics and the \pkg{xlrd} for reading excel files. You can install these packages with the code below if needed  
  (see \refsec{installing} for more details):
  
\doublecodex{ch_data_wrangling/chapter07install}

\noindent After installing, you need to import (activate) the packages every session:

\doublecodex{ch_data_wrangling/chapter07library}
