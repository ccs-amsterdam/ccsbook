\section{Understanding errors and getting help}
\label{sec:errors}


Programming can be a frustrating endeavour, and you will encounter error messages, bugs, and problems that you donâ€™t know how to fix. This section shows how error messages are useful rather than scary and lists the main error messages encountered in the beginning. It explains how to search for help within the R/Python documentation, how to use online resources, and how to formulate questions to your instructor or community so you get a useful answer.
