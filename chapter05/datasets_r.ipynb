Cubs ERA at 0.056 while Braves at 0.059. We know it is early        in the season, we Cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the        short triumph while it is still there.

Article-I.D.: pion.Apr.6.12.05.34.1993.11732 Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Lines: 26    Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!  The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped.  I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient.  Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...  Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!  gnelson@physics.rutgers.edu

Lines: 28  &gt; ATTENTION: Mac Quadra owners: Many storage industry experts have &gt; concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating &gt; from the standard SCSI specification. This results in silent corruption &gt; of data when used with some devices, including ultra-modern devices. &gt; Although I will not name the devices, since it is not their fault, an &gt; example would be a Sony 3.5 inch MO, without the special \"Mac-compatible\" &gt; firmware installed. One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\" &gt;  To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of &gt;16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and it seems I would have to give up my mouse.  Please, can someone help me?

Cubs ERA at 0.056 while Braves at 0.059.

Article-I.D.: pion.Apr.6.12.05.34.1993.11732 Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Lines: 26    Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one \\_with\\_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up \\_before\\_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!  The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped.  I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient.  Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...  Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!  gnelson@physics.rutgers.edu

One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\" >  To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

       "\t 5 &  4 & From: taihou@chromium.iss.nus.sg (Tng Tai Hou) Subject: ADB and graphics tablet help! Organization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS Lines: 13  Help!!!  I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and it seems I would have to give up my mouse.  Please, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).  Thanks in advance.

Cubs ERA at 0.056 while Braves at 0.059. We know it is early        in the season, we Cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the        short triumph while it is still there.

       "| 1 |  4 | From: gnelson@pion.rutgers.edu (Gregory Nelson) Subject: Thanks Apple: Free Ethernet on my C610! Article-I.D.: pion.Apr.6.12.05.34.1993.11732 Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Lines: 26    Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!  The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped.  I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient.  Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...  Anyway, above all, it's fast.

       "| 3 |  4 | From:  () Subject: Re: Quadra SCSI Problems??? Organization: Apple Computer Inc. Lines: 28  &gt; ATTENTION: Mac Quadra owners: Many storage industry experts have &gt; concluded that Mac Quadras suffer from timing irregularities deviating &gt; from the standard SCSI specification. This results in silent corruption &gt; of data when used with some devices, including ultra-modern devices. &gt; Although I will not name the devices, since it is not their fault, an &gt; example would be a Sony 3.5 inch MO, without the special \"Mac-compatible\" &gt; firmware installed. One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\" &gt;  To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of &gt;16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

I think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree. Domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild.  I don't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the wild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years to produce certain behaviors, etc.  keith

       "| 5 |  4 | From: taihou@chromium.iss.nus.sg (Tng Tai Hou) Subject: ADB and graphics tablet help! Organization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS Lines: 13  Help!!!  I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and it seems I would have to give up my mouse.  Please, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).  Thanks in advance.

Cubs ERA at 0.056 while Braves at 0.059. We know it is early        in the season, we Cubs fans have learned how to enjoy the        short triumph while it is still there.

       "2 From: gnelson@pion.rutgers.edu (Gregory Nelson) Subject: Thanks Apple: Free Ethernet on my C610! Article-I.D.: pion.Apr.6.12.05.34.1993.11732 Organization: Rutgers Univ., New Brunswick, N.J. Lines: 26    Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over two  weeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)  appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I ordered the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet. He wanted to know if that would be \"alright with me\"!!!  They must be backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them with!     Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.   Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first time.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected (must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have been pissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!  The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I've heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to get it swapped.  I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  This wasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the location of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control for these functions was much more convenient.  Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up. I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...  Anyway, above all, it's fast.

One solution, sometimes, is to disable \"blind writes\" >  To the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with Quadras and blind transfers.  Trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer screwed up the TIBs or didn't test their driver with the device in question. Well designed TIBs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur. This usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some devices can \"hiccup\" in the middle of blocks.  If this happens in the middle of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  In anycase the SCSI Manager will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because it is out of sync.  Actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't pay attention to the errors coming back.  Note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the SCSI Bus but rather by the transfer loops inside the SCSI Manager.  The problem occurs when the processor bus errors trying to access the SCSI chip when the next byte hasn't been clocked yet.  Also note that the Bus Error is dealt with by a bus error handler and doesn't crash the machine...

       "6 From: taihou@chromium.iss.nus.sg (Tng Tai Hou) Subject: ADB and graphics tablet help! Organization: Institute Of Systems Science, NUS Lines: 13  Help!!!  I have an ADB graphicsd tablet which I want to connect to my Quadra 950. Unfortunately, the 950 has only one ADB port and it seems I would have to give up my mouse.  Please, can someone help me? I want to use the tablet as well as the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).  Thanks in advance.
